# TODO - Potential Improvements

This document lists potential improvements and considerations for the project.

## Repository Configuration

### Branch Protection Rules
Consider enabling branch protection rules for `main` branch:
- Require pull request reviews
- Require status checks to pass before merging
- Include administrators in restrictions (optional)
- Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed

This would provide additional safety for the main branch, though it may require manual approval for release PRs.

### GitHub Actions
- Add dependency caching for Gradle builds to speed up CI/CD
- Consider adding automated security scanning
- Add automated dependency updates (Dependabot)

## Release Process
- Consider adding changelog generation based on conventional commits
- Add release candidate workflow for testing before final release
- Implement semantic versioning automation based on commit messages

## Code Quality
- Add static code analysis (ktlint, detekt)
- Implement code coverage thresholds
- Add performance benchmarking for releases

## Documentation
- Add API documentation generation and publishing
- Create more comprehensive usage examples
- Add migration guides for major version changes
